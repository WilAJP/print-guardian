# print-guardian
A monitoring and safety system for the Prusa i3 MK3S 3D printer. This project ensures 24/7 oversight of print jobs by 
integrating real time status updates, error detection, time lapse photo taking, and automated shut downs incase of 
errors. It also provides notifications for a complete job and maintains a log of print job history.
